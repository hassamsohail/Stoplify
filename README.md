# React Native Expo Project

## Overview

This project is a React Native application built with Expo. It includes configurations and setup instructions for running the app on Android and iOS emulators.

## Environment Variables

Before running the project, ensure you have the following environment variables set up:

### 1. `EXPO_APP_ID`
- **Description:** Unique identifier for your Expo app.
- **Required:** Yes

### 2. `EXPO_APP_SECRET`
- **Description:** Secret key for your Expo app (if applicable).
- **Required:** Yes, if your app uses secret keys.

### 3. `API_URL`
- **Description:** Base URL for your API endpoints.
- **Required:** Yes

### 4. `ENVIRONMENT`
- **Description:** Defines the environment (`development`, `staging`, `production`).
- **Required:** Yes

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

or

```sh
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add your environment variables:

```
EXPO_APP_ID=your_expo_app_id
EXPO_APP_SECRET=your_expo_app_secret
API_URL=https://api.yourservice.com
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### 3. Install Expo CLI

If you don't have Expo CLI installed, you can install it globally:

```sh
npm install -g expo-cli
```

or

```sh
yarn global add expo-cli
```

## Running the Project

### 1. Start the Development Server

To start the Expo development server, run:

```sh
expo start
```

This will open a new tab in your default web browser showing the Expo developer tools.

### 2. Running on Android Emulator

1. **Ensure you have Android Studio installed** and the Android Virtual Device (AVD) set up.
2. **Start your Android emulator** from Android Studio.
3. **In the Expo developer tools**, click on "Run on Android device/emulator" or press `a` in the terminal where Expo is running.

### 3. Running on iOS Emulator

1. **Ensure you have Xcode installed** (macOS only).
2. **Start the iOS simulator** from Xcode or by running:

   ```sh
   open -a Simulator
   ```

3. **In the Expo developer tools**, click on "Run on iOS simulator" or press `i` in the terminal where Expo is running.

## Building for Production

To build your app for production, use the following commands:

- **Android:** 

   ```sh
   expo build:android
   ```

- **iOS:**

   ```sh
   expo build:ios
   ```

Follow the prompts and instructions to complete the build process.
